## PDF Chatbot with Enhanced Interaction Experience

This application empowers users to engage in meaningful interactions with textual content extracted from uploaded PDF documents. 
The central focus of this project is to enable multi-turn conversations with the chatbot while ensuring the preservation of conversation context and history.
This functionality is designed to facilitate seamless and interactive information retrieval.

Functional Requirements:

Multi-turn Conversation:

The chatbot supports multi-turn conversations, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and maintain a continuous dialogue.
The chatbot remembers the context throughout the conversation, ensuring that interactions feel natural and coherent.
Context Preservation:

The chatbot retains context from prior interactions, including previous questions and responses.
This feature enables the chatbot to engage intelligently in a conversation, taking into account what has been discussed earlier.
Defining Conversation Boundaries:

The application defines clear starting and ending points for each interaction with the chatbot.
This practice is essential for effectively structuring and managing the flow of communication, resulting in well-organized and coherent conversations.
Enhancements:

Chat History:

Implemented a feature that displays the chat history on the left side of the app.
Users can review previous interactions, and the chat history updates in real-time as new messages are exchanged.
New Chat Button:

Added a new chat button or a similar user interface element that allows users to start a fresh conversation easily.
This enhances the user experience by providing a clear mechanism to initiate new interactions.
User Experience:

Ensured that the new features are seamlessly integrated into the existing app.
User interactions, including PDF uploads, questions, and responses, remain functional and user-friendly.
The interface maintains a clean and intuitive design, prioritizing a positive user experience.
